# Orbital-Transfer-Calculator-MATLAB
Computational tool designed to simulate and analyze orbital transfer maneuvers using classical astrodynamics/orbital mechanics. This project supports three fundamental transfer methods—Hohmann, Bi-Elliptical, and One-Tangent Transfers—providing accurate delta-V computations, trajectory planning, and clear 3D orbital visualizations.

I developed this tool primarily for academic use, research support, and aerospace education. The tool calculate all possible parameters and evaluates transfer efficiencies between circular or elliptical orbits with visual output to enable better understanding of transfer arcs, intermediate orbits, and burn locations.

## 🚀 Features
- Accurate delta-V computation
