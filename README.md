# Orbital-Transfer-Calculator-MATLAB
Computational tool designed to simulate and analyze orbital transfer maneuvers using classical astrodynamics/orbital mechanics. This project supports three fundamental transfer methods—Hohmann, Bi-Elliptical, and One-Tangent Transfers—providing accurate delta-V computations, trajectory planning, and clear 3D orbital visualizations.
